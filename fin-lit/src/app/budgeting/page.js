            <h2>What Is A Budget:</h2>
            <p>A budget is a comprehensive financial plan that outlines an individual's or organization's projected income and expenses over a specified period. It serves as a strategic tool for managing finances, enabling one to allocate resources effectively, prioritize spending, and achieve financial goals. A well-structured budget involves tracking all sources of income, categorizing expenditures into fixed and variable costs, setting financial targets, and monitoring actual spending against the plan. By maintaining a budget, one can ensure financial stability, avoid overspending, and systematically save for future needs and investments.
